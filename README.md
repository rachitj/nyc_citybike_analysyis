# Description
Alta Bicycle Share, the company that owns and operates the Citi Bike program, is facing some unexpected financial difficulties as a result of dropping sponsorship revenue for the bike share program. Faced with a revenue shortfall, Alta would like you to mine the Citi Bike stations and trips data to come up with solutions and projected revenue impact, or alternatively investigate ways to reduce expenses such as the number of operating stations, without impacting ride volume too negatively.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to do a deep dive analysis on citybike data to come up with solutions and projected revenue impact, or alternatively investigate ways to reduce expenses.

# Deliverables
1. A set of SQL queries you undertake to understand the underlying data
2. A Python script which includes deeper analyses of the data
3. A few charts and summary text to capture the ‘story’ of your analyses/recommendations You can choose to combine these outputs in a single file such as a Jupyter notebook, or present them as separate files.
